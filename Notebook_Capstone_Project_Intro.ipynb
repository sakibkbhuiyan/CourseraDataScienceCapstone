    "Food deserts are geographic areas where access to affordable, healthy food options is limited because grocery stores are too far away. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 23.5 million Americans live in food deserts, and nearly half of them are also low-income. This limited access to grocery stores can lead to several long-term issues. Many people living in food deserts get meals from fast-food restaurants. Furthermore, food insecurity has a high correlation with increased diabetes rates. [5].  The lack of access to healthful foods can also contribute to other diet-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of food deserts has become both a public health and political issue in my hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina [2]. Food deserts are more prevalent among minority communities, and the detrimental consequences are exacerbated by a lack of transportation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will attempt to **better understand which areas in Charlotte have limited access to grocery stores**. We will **use location data from the Foursquare Places API** to visualize the presence of grocery stores on maps. We will also use visualizations to **understand which areas in Charlotte could most benefit from new grocery store openings**. These results can be used by city planners and grocery store chains to prioritize grocery store openings in a way that **makes healthy food options accessible** to more (and, hopefully, all) Charlotteans.
